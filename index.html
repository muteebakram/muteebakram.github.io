                I am a computer science graduate student at the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. I
                work with Prof. Vijay Nagarajan on re-imagining applications on CXL Memory. I am also a teaching
                assistant for senior undergrad students to assist in their Capstone Project. My research interest lies
                in the intersection of hardware/software and multi-node systems, i.e., computer architecture, operating
                systems, and distributed systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, I worked at Cisco Systems in the Cloud & Compute Team in Bangalore, India. Joined as a
                college
                intern and left as a Software Engineer 2. Here, I worked on cutting-edge enterprise hardware and
                developed industry-standard Redfish APIs to diagnose, firmware update, and install operating systems for
                Cisco UCS servers. Cisco was
                my first stint in software and the world of systems. I thoroughly enjoyed the technical challenges and
                developed a fond interest in computer systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that, I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science at R. V. College of Engineering (RVCE) in
                Bangalore, India. I worked with Prof. Rajashree Shettar, Prof. Minal Moharir, and Prof. Veena Gadad on
                the traffic decongestion system, HTTP3/QUIC protocol, and DMTF's Redfish API for server firmware
                management, respectively. I was part of the entrepreneurship cell and volunteered for the Rotaract Club
                of RVCE.
