                    I'm currently pursuing my graduate studies in computer science at the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utah.edu">Kahlert School of Computing</a>,
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.utah.edu">University of Utah</a>. Under the guidance of
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~vijay/index.html">Prof. Vijay Nagarajan</a>,
                    my research focuses on re-imagining applications on CXL Memory. Additionally, I serve as a teaching
                    assistant, supporting senior undergraduate students in their Capstone Project. My research interest
                    lies in the intersection of hardware/software and multi-node systems, i.e., computer architecture,
                    operating systems, and distributed systems.

                    Before, I was part of the Cloud & Compute Team at <a href="https://www.cisco.com">Cisco Systems</a>
                    in Bangalore, India. I started as a college intern and progressed to the role of Software Engineer 2
                    before leaving. During my time there, I worked on cutting-edge enterprise hardware projects and
                    played a key role in developing industry-standard
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish">DMTF Redfish APIs</a>.
                    These APIs were designed for diagnosing issues, updating firmware, and installing operating systems
                    for
                    <a target="_blank"

                        UCS servers</a>.
                    My experience at Cisco marked my introduction to the software field and the intricacies of systems.
                    I found immense satisfaction in tackling technical challenges and developed a keen interest in
                    computer systems. developed a fond interest in computer systems.

                <p>
                    Before that, I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science at
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://rvce.edu.in">R. V. College of Engineering (RVCE)</a> in
                    Bangalore, India. I worked with Prof. Rajashree Shettar, Prof. Minal Moharir, and Prof. Veena Gadad
                    on the traffic decongestion system, HTTP3/QUIC protocol survey, and server firmware
                    management, respectively. Additionally, I was member of the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://ecellrvce.in">Entrepreneurship Cell</a> and a volunteer for
                    the Rotaract Club of RVCE.

                    I'm forever grateful to my mother, father, younger brother, sister, well-wishers, and teachers for
                    their unconditional help, love, and support. The positive aspects of my life reflect their profound
                    influence, while I take full responsibility for my any negative aspects.
