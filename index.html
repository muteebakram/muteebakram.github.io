            I'm currently pursuing my graduate studies in computer science at the Kahlert School of Computing,
            University of Utah. Under the guidance of Prof. Vijay Nagarajan, my research focuses on re-imagining
            applications on CXL Memory. Additionally, I serve as a teaching assistant, supporting senior
            undergraduate students in their Capstone Project. My research interest lies in the intersection of
            hardware/software and multi-node systems, i.e., computer architecture, operating
            systems, and distributed systems.

            Before, I was part of the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/computing/index.html">
                Cloud & Compute</a> Team at <a href="https://www.cisco.com">Cisco Systems</a> in Bangalore, India. I
            started as a college intern and progressed to the role of Software Engineer 2 before leaving. During my time
            there, I worked on cutting-edge enterprise hardware projects and played a key role in developing
            industry-standard DMTF Redfish APIs. These APIs were designed for diagnosing issues, updating firmware, and
            installing operating systems for Cisco UCS servers. My experience at Cisco marked my introduction to the
            software field and the intricacies of systems.I found immense satisfaction in tackling technical
            challenges and developed a keen interest in computer systems.
            developed a fond interest in computer systems.

            Before that, I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science at R. V. College of Engineering (RVCE) in
            Bangalore, India. I worked with Prof. Rajashree Shettar, Prof. Minal Moharir, and Prof. Veena Gadad on
            the traffic decongestion system, HTTP3/QUIC protocol survey, and server firmware
            management, respectively. Additionally, I was member of the entrepreneurship cell and a volunteer for
            the Rotaract Club
            of RVCE.
