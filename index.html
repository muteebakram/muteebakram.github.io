                    I'm pursuing my graduate studies in computer science at the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utah.edu">Kahlert School of Computing</a>,
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.utah.edu">University of Utah</a>. Under the guidance of
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~vijay/index.html">Prof. Vijay Nagarajan</a>,
                    my research focuses on re-imagining applications on CXL Memory. Additionally, I serve as a teaching
                    assistant, helping senior undergraduate students in their capstone projects. My research interest
                    lies in the intersection of hardware/software of computer systems, i.e., computer architecture,
                    operating systems, distributed systems, and embedded systems.

                    Before Utah, I was part of the Cloud & Compute Team at <a href="https://www.cisco.com">Cisco
                        Systems</a>
                    in Bangalore, India. I started as a college intern and progressed to the role of Software Engineer 2
                    before leaving. While there, I worked on cutting-edge enterprise hardware and
                    implemented industry-standard
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish">DMTF Redfish APIs</a>
                    for diagnosing hardware, updating firmware, disk data
                    sanitization, and installing operating systems for
                    <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/computing/servers-unified-computing-systems/index.html">
                        Cisco UCS servers</a>.
                    My experience at Cisco marked my introduction to the software industry.
                    I found immense joy in tackling technical challenges and developed a keen interest in
                    systems.

                <p>
                    Before Cisco, I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science at
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://rvce.edu.in">R. V. College of Engineering (RVCE)</a> in
                    Bangalore, India. I worked with Prof. Rajashree Shettar, Prof. Minal Moharir, and Prof. Veena Gadad
                    on the traffic decongestion system, HTTP3/QUIC protocol survey, and server firmware
                    management, respectively. Additionally, I was a member of the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://ecellrvce.in">Entrepreneurship Cell</a> and a volunteer for
                    the Rotaract Club of RVCE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before RVCE, I did my pre-university education with Deeksha Integrated Learning at
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.revapucollege.edu.in/yelahanka/about-yelahanka">
                        Reva Independent PU College</a>, Bangalore, India. It is here where I learned how to study and the importance of
                    education and hard work. The passion and support of the teachers here truly inspired me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It all started at <a target="_blank" href="https://deepayanschool.com">Deepayan School</a>, Hospet, India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm forever grateful to my mother, father, younger brother, sister, well-wishers, and teachers for
                    their unconditional love, guidance, and support.
