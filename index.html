                I'm currently pursuing my graduate studies in computer science at the Kahlert School of Computing,
                University of Utah. Under the guidance of Prof. Vijay Nagarajan, my research focuses on re-imagining
                applications on CXL Memory. Additionally, I serve as a teaching assistant, supporting senior
                undergraduate students in their Capstone Project. My research interest lies in the intersection of
                hardware/software and multi-node systems, i.e., computer architecture, operating
                systems, and distributed systems.

                Before, I was part of the Cloud & Compute Team at Cisco Systems in Bangalore, India. I started as a
                college intern and progressed to the role of Software Engineer 2 before leaving. During my time there, I
                worked on cutting-edge enterprise hardware projects and played a key role in developing
                industry-standard Redfish APIs. These APIs were designed for diagnosing issues, updating firmware, and
                installing operating systems for Cisco UCS servers. My experience at Cisco marked my introduction to the
                software field and the intricacies of systems.I found immense satisfaction in tackling technical
                challenges and developed a keen interest in computer systems.
                developed a fond interest in computer systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that, I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science at R. V. College of Engineering (RVCE) in
                Bangalore, India. I worked with Prof. Rajashree Shettar, Prof. Minal Moharir, and Prof. Veena Gadad on
                the traffic decongestion system, HTTP3/QUIC protocol survey, and DMTF's Redfish API for server firmware
                management, respectively. Additionally, I was member of the entrepreneurship cell and a volunteer for
                the Rotaract Club
                of RVCE.
